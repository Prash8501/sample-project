<h3 style="font-family:verdana; color: #2E86C1";>What is a Calendar ?</h3>
<p>A calendar is a system of organizing days. 
This is done by giving names to periods of time, typically days, weeks, months and years.
 A date is the designation of a single, specific day within such a system. 
 A calendar is also a physical record (often paper) of such a system. 
 A calendar can also mean a list of planned events, such as a court calendar or a partly or fully chronological list of documents, such as a calendar of wills.</p>
 <p>Periods in a calendar (such as years and months) are usually, 
 though not necessarily, synchronized with the cycle of the sun or the moon. 
 The most common type of pre-modern calendar was the lunisolar calendar, 
 a lunar calendar that occasionally adds one intercalary month to remain 
 synchronized with the solar year over the long term.</p>
 <h3 style="font-family:verdana; color: #2E86C1";>History of Calendars</h3>
 <p>The history of calendars, that is, of people creating and using methods 
 for keeping track of days and larger divisions of time, covers a practice 
 with ancient roots.</p>
<p>
Archeologists have reconstructed methods of timekeeping that go back to 
prehistoric times at least as old as the Neolithic. The natural units for 
timekeeping used by most historical societies are the day, the solar year 
and the lunation. Calendars are explicit schemes used for timekeeping. 
The first historically attested and formulized calendars date to the Bronze Age, 
dependent on the development of writing in the ancient Near East. 
The Sumerian calendar was the earliest, followed by the Egyptian, 
Assyrian and Elamite calendars.
</p>
<p>
A larger number of calendar systems of the ancient Near East appear in 
the Iron Age archaeological record, based on the Assyrian and Babylonian calendars. 
This includes the calendar of the Persian Empire, 
which in turn gave rise to the Zoroastrian 
calendar as well as the Hebrew calendar.</p>

 <h3 style="font-family:verdana; color: #2E86C1";>How Many Calendars Are There?</h3>
 <p>There are over 40 different calendars used around the world. Many countries and religions have their own calendar to track the days, months, and years. 
 Here are the 3 main types of calendars:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Lunar</li>
 <li>Solar</li>
 <li>Lunisolar</li>
 </ul>
 <h3 style="font-family:verdana";>Explanation of each type of calendars</h3>
 <p><strong>1. Lunar</strong></p>
 </p>A lunar calendar tracks time using the monthly cycles of the moon’s phases. 
 It measures the time between one new moon to the next.</p>

 <p><strong>2. Solar</strong></p>
 <p>A solar calendar is based on a solar year, which is the time it takes for Earth to rotate around the sun. 
 It measures the time between vernal equinoxes.</p>

 <p><strong>3. Lunisolar</strong></p>
 <p>A lunisolar calendar uses both the moon phases 
 and the time of the solar year to track time.

Throughout history, each country and religion has used a lunar, solar, or lunisolar calendar. 
We’re basically all over the place when it comes to tracking time!</p>

<h3 style="font-family:verdana; color: #2E86C1"> What's the difference between a Lunar and Solar Year ?</h3>
<p> A lunar year is based on the time it takes for the moon to go through each of its phases
 (new moon, half moon, and full moon). 
 A solar year, on the other hand, 
 is the time it takes for the Earth to complete one revolution around the sun.</p>
