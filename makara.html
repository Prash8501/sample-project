    <i><u><b><h2 align="center" style="color: green;" >HEALTH :</h2></b></u></i>
    <h3 align="center" style="color:black;">This year, your health will remain good. Shani’s Sadhe Sati greatly affected your health last year. After April, your health will begin to gradually improve. If your work demands a lot of physical activity, then you should preferably take a nutrition-rich diet. Work-related stress might make you a patient of hypertension. Practice Yoga daily and don’t take any stress. Include fiber-rich foods in your diet; this will improve your digestion. This will also make you immune against many diseases. The condition of arthritis patients may exacerbate in January and July.</h3>
    <i><u><b><h2 align="center" style="color:blue;" >FINANCIAL CONDITION:</h2></b></u></i>
    <h3 align="center" style="color: black;">You will be wealthier this year compared to the last one. You may purchase jewelry, especially gold jewelry. Jupiter’s transit in the second house will give you huge profits in the business. You may also inherit your ancestral property. Your expenses will increase, but you will balance them by increasing your earnings. During the mid-year, your money may get wasted on unnecessary things. You will avoid purchasing vehicles this year.</h3>
    <i><u><b><h2 align="center" style="color: orangered;" >FAMILY AND SOCIAL LIFE:</h2></b></u></i>
    <h3 align="center" style="color: black;">During the beginning of the year, there would be peace and prosperity in your family. But with the transit of Rahu and Jupiter in April, you might face some problems. Property-related disputes may emerge. Your near and dear ones will betray you. It wouldn’t be wise to share your secrets with others. Don’t let other people interfere in your married life. During the year-end, you will be worried about the future of your children. The health of your mother may deteriorate. Overall, the year will be full of ups and downs for your family life.</h3>
    <i><u><b><h2 align="center" style="color: RED;" >LOVE LIFE:</h2></b></u></i>
    <h3 align="center" style="color: black;">You will be very romantic. You will spend enough time with your life partner. You may get into a new love relationship during the first three months. Don’t make hasty decisions regarding marriage. During the mid-year, you may face problems due to your life partner’s health. Conflicts and disagreements may emerge between partners. Don’t impose your choices on your partner. You may even engage in legal battles against your partner. Towards the year-end, you will find some respite in your problems.</h3>
    <i><u><b><h2 align="center" style="color:blueviolet;" >EDUCATION AND CARRER :</h2></b></u></i>
    <h3 align="center" style="color: black;">The year would be favourable from the career’s perspective. Your education will benefit you on the professional front. Students preparing to pursue higher education will get success in their endeavours. The income of businesspeople will increase. You may also expand your business. However, you will need to work most diligently to achieve your business expansion goals. The year will bring success for people working in the finance sector. There are chances of promotion as well as transfer in the job. Youngsters will be excited about their start-up. The periods from September to December will be most favourable from the career point of view. You will make good use of your contacts.</h3>
