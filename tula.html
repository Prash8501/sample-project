    <i><u><b><h2 align="center" style="color: green;" >HEALTH :</h2></b></u></i>
    <h3 align="center" style="color:black;">This year, you will have to work extra hard. So, your body and mind will need a proper rest. In lack of proper rest, you might feel tired and also catch viral infections. If you often have headache, then don’t take it lightly and consult with an eye specialist. In January, you may face health problems due to your undisciplined lifestyle. Take special care of your health at least till April. During mid-year, your health will be mostly good. But acidity will trouble you. Jogging early mornings will immensely benefit you.</h3>
    <i><u><b><h2 align="center" style="color:blue;" >FINANCIAL CONDITION:</h2></b></u></i>
    <h3 align="center" style="color: black;">This year, you may face financial struggles. You will only get success after hard work and persistent efforts. You might purchase a new shop. All those works that were hindered due to lack of funds will get executed this year. After April 13th, the transit of Rahu and Jupiter will be favourable for your career. Avoid unnecessary expenses. You might face financial distress in the months of May and July. The last two months will be most favourable from the financial perspective.</h3>
    <i><u><b><h2 align="center" style="color: orangered;" >FAMILY AND SOCIAL LIFE:</h2></b></u></i>
    <h3 align="center" style="color: black;">The year will be propitious for the growth and success of your family. You might plan to conduct an event at the beginning of the year. You will enjoy cordial relationships with your in-laws’ families. The success of your children will keep you delighted. Your friends will help and support you in every situation. The months of January, April and October are not favourable to you. In the mid-year, you will be worried about the health of your children. The health of your parents will be generally good. But take a little care during the year-end.</h3>
    <i><u><b><h2 align="center" style="color: RED;" >LOVE LIFE:</h2></b></u></i>
    <h3 align="center" style="color: black;"> This year, you will need to be extra careful about your marital relationship. Rahu’s transit in the seventh house will be favourable for love relationships; however, it will create tensions between husbands and wives. If you will be able to maintain transparency in your relationship, it will solve a lot of your problems. Instead of paying heed to what others say, learn to have healthy communication with your partner. Remain extra careful in the months of April and May. Unmarried people will be excited about their marriage.</h3>
    <i><u><b><h2 align="center" style="color:blueviolet;" >EDUCATION AND CARRER :</h2></b></u></i>
    <h3 align="center" style="color: black;"> This year, you should make well-thought-out investments. The income of those who are associated with the hotel and tourism industry will increase. You might expand your business. But avoid taking big risks. Children will try to learn new things. There might be some problems regarding higher education. Keep your self-confidence high. Medical students will achieve excellent results in academics. People who are preparing for competitive exams will achieve big success. The period from April and October will be troublesome from work’s perspective.</h3>
